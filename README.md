## Overview
- This is a CraftTweaker/GroovyScript addon that enables you to add more fluid interactions using the `zenscript`/`groovyscript`.
- This mod doesn't extend anything on the vanilla water and lava interaction system. Instead, the mod creates a new general system for fluid interactions.
- It can also act as a library mod for fluid interactions.

## Features
### Fluid Interaction
- Fluid turns into another block when it comes into contact with another fluid.
- Fluid turns into another block when it comes into contact with a block.
- A block turns into another block when it comes into contact with fluid. 
- Any of the above reactions can trigger a series of events. The available events are as follows:
  - Placing a block
  - Explosion
  - Spawning an entity
  - Spawning an item
  - Placing a fluid (experimental)
### Fluid Behavior
- Fluids can perform a series of actions. The available actions are as follows:
  - Applying potion effects
  - Entity conversion
  - Instant forced fire extinguishing
  - Igniting nearby blocks
  - Covering nearby blocks with snow
  - Teleporting entities
  - Breaking blocks (experimental; only supports OreDict for now)
### JEI Compatibilities
- Thermal Foundation

## Todo List
- Update groovy support
- Finish `bop`-jei compat (maybe also fixing `bop`'s buggy fluid interactions)
- Add `abyssalcraft`-jei compat
- Add more conditions for interaction and behavior
- Add `abyssalcraft`-like limited fluid spread mechanism
- Add configurable boolean expressions for conditions
